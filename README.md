# airbnb-clone-project
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.
# Team Roles
Back-end developers, in turn, implement the core of an app—its algorithms and business logic. Experienced back-end developers not only write code but also do the tasks of an architect—for example, devise an app architecture or design and implement the necessary integrations.
# Technology Stack
Django: A web framework for building RESTful APIs.
PostgreSQL: An open-source, object-relational database. It’s designed for enterprise-level performance and is valued for its robust features and reliability.
GraphQL: GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. G
